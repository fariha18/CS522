# Built android apps using Android Studio 
As a current undergraduate enrolled in a graduate-level course at Stevens Institute of Technology, 
I have gained expertise building andorid apps using Android Studios (Java) and have learned various implementation techniques. Throughout the course, 
I have studied how to develop and operate applications on mobile computing platforms, manage data and power using algorithms and strategies, 
and understand wireless communication protocols such as cell phone and LAN protocols, and network protocols for mobile applications. 
Additionally, I have learned about threats and countermeasures used to secure mobile devices, and how to design context scenarios and personas 
for enhancing user experience (UX) engineering in mobile applications. Furthermore, I have gained knowledge on how to apply design patterns 
and software architectures to efficiently manage the complexity of mobile applications, including cloud-based apps.
